# cst205-final-project
Our Python project for CST 205: Multimedia Programming 

Welcome to the Pixel Shop! this website was made by Justin, Kaden, Siberaja, and Kyle. Explore our collection of pixel art tools and procedural generation algorithms.

Hello! My name is Justin and i made pixel art web application using Python and Flask. It allows users to upload an image, choose a pixel size, and convert the image into a pixelated version by grouping pixels into blocks of color. The pixelated image is saved to a gallery folder with a unique filename and displayed on the webpage, where users can also view previously generated pixel art images.

Hello! My name is Kaden, and I made the filter part of our project! You upload whatever picture you want, and it adds a silly filter on it! Once you click the button it will either, flip the image upside down, resize the image, or change the color of it! It also can do everything at the same time! You can click the button as many times as you want to see if you like that filter or not, there's many ways you can play, and mess around with it, and it's almost impossible to get the same one again!

Hello, my name is Siberaja. I created a dotted image converter using Python and Flask. It allows users to upload an image and convert it to grayscale. Based on the pixel brightness, it selects the appropriate dot size.

Hello, I'm Kyle! I made the Wave Function Collapse section of this project. This tool generates unique pixel art cities using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm. Each time you refresh the page, a new tiny town image is created, showcasing different layouts and designs. It's a fun way to explore procedural generation and see how algorithms can create interesting pixel art landscapes!

We hope you have fun exploring this fun multi-media pixel art website!


Future work:
If we had more time, it would be fun to play around with different sliders for the WFC algorithm. We could even add more tilesets to create different images than a city.
